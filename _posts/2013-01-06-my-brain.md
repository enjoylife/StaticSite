As I am getting older I can safely say that with each passing day I understand my tendencies and thought patterns just a little bit better.With that said, I think I have narrowed my brains standard day to day activities to two distinct scenarios.

I think of lots of ideas that seem good one second, but then, given just a little bit of thought, turn out to be a complete wast of time.  Basically I have alot of thoughts that shouldn't even have been thought of in the first place.

You know how in a group setting you might have an initial brainstorming of ideas and it's often courteous to delay any sort of putting down of someones idea's for they say it discourages creativity? Well think of one side of my brain as the bold, over the top person who shouts out terrible ideas that are just so stupid you wonder where they came from, and then the other side is the critical person who lives to shoot down the retarded ideas. And just imagine that this is a never ending brainstorming session where these two go at it for &infin; and nothing gets done.

That's my brain.
