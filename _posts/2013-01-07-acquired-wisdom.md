One of the more valuable things I have picked up on as I experience and age, is the ability to be organized with very little extra applied effort. I can truthfully say that my younger self was foolishly overconfident In my abilities to keep track of things. Thinking I could consistently keep track of stuff solely with my memory was a large barrier to the expansion of my knowledge. I discovered  a new pace of learning when I began to   place things in categories and made recording of things as need be. This relieved my mind of the burden of trying to piece it all together,which unfortunately was most often than not, ending up haphazardly forgotten.
