This is supposed to be my blog.

I dont't know exactly what I'm going to be posting about, but I know that I will have lots to say. . . . Probably not though. Will see in a few months if this is still the only post and if I can keep the promise to myself of constantly updating this shit. 


Really all this whole thing is supposed to be is a place for me to write about things that would be either too long for an evernote, or too weird for a facebook post (aka math). Also a side-effect would be to have some sort of public record of my thoughts, that wasn't stored or controlled in some closed service, a la google drive, dropbox, evernote, etc. It's not like im paranoid about such a service but there is still just the principle of it.

So here's to a weird and introverted first post full of errors, stupidity and immaturity.
