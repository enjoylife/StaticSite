"What would you like to learn." This was the question that was asked by our professor [Barry Brown] [barry] in Intermediate object-orientated Programming __(cs13)__. The reason behind the question, according to him, is that this was a more advanced class, and we should decide on what we would devote the rest of the time to. 
A few sugguestions were thrown out, client server application, simple game AI, etc, but for the most part everyone was silient. No one really had any definitive opinions and  I started to get that feeling that this class was going to take a eternity.

Silence. An unanimous feeling of boredum was spreading around the room.

"Ok well an intersting topic that could be managable for the class and intersting for all involved is Artifical Neural Networks."

Once prof. Brown said this, a few people who where silently day-dreaming sorta snapped out of it, including myself and I quickly looked up it's [wiki] [ann] page. Prof. Brown noticed the intrigue from the class and he started to go on about what it was, and where it would be applied, etc. I was slowly drowning that out and focusing on all the new tabs had just popped open on the matter.

Jumping to and from wiki links, I came across terms I was unfamilier with such as, [Simulated annealing] [anneal], [non-parametric methods] [para], and some more familer ones, Machine learning, cost functions, directed acyclic graph.And at this point I was completely tuned out to what Prof. Brown was talking about, but it didn't matter because I was enjoying the understanding of how I would  actually go about implementing this type of  machine learning tool. 

With class over, a spare hour before next class, and with a new topic boucning back in forth in my mind, I started pulling up various resources on the subject while in the library, trying to learn about this from as many different angles as possible. Here are my [notes][enote]. It's a link to an Evernote with links and my sketchbook pics. Drawing out my notes helps me alot in connecting different topics. And remembering the notes later is far easier with an index and storage solution like [evernote][ever].
