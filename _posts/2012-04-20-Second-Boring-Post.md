title: Lots of not so good ideas
tags: [ideas, initial]

My brain thinks of lots of ideas that seem good one second, but then given just a little bit of thought, I realize that that is just a complete wast of time. Shouldn't even have thought of it in the first place.

You know how in a group setting you might have an initial brainstorming of ideas and it's often courteous to delay any sort of putting down of some ones idea's for they say it discourages creativity? Well think of one side of my brain as the bold, over the top person who shouts out   terrible ideas that are just so stupid you wonder where they came from, and then the other side is the critical person who lives to shoot down the retarded ideas.

<aside>By forever I mean &#8734;, infinity, eternal, every waking and non-waking moment. Get the idea?</aside>

And then think of a never ending brainstorming session where these two go at it __forever__ and nothing gets done.

That's my brain.
