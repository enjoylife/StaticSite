"Given enough time anything is possible" - some random person sometime in
history.

If only it was that easy. Just slowly think about it and eventually something will just figure itself out. Yeah, that's not ever gonna happen to me. I am way too unlucky and no where near smart enough to have things just magically work themselves out.

Things have to be put into action in order for anything to be acomplished. Just theorizing and projecting what could be, just does not cut it for me anymore. I do not take solace anymore when I think of the potential of things. I need action. Problem is taking action is far more work than just dreaming some shit up. And within that lies my problem, to much daydreaming about what if's.

So what is a solution for myself? Well there is plenty of possiblites, some far superior, or shorter, or just plain easier. A list might help perhaps.

* stop overthinking things might help.
* Stop jumping from problem to problem and focus more on specifics. 
* Perhaps less time in the abstract brainstorming stage.

Here's the irony in all of this though. In the process of quickly writting out of some abstract solutions, I am once again delaying and procrastinating once more on random shit that could have been started 20 minutes ago. Oh well, old habits are hard to break.
