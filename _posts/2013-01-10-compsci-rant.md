When I am curious and have a thirst for knowledge in a specific topic of the large field of computer science, I more often than not, first look to a quick google search. I can't count the number of times where a top ranked wiki page or a well formed blog post gave me more valuable insight than my university class. This is logically understandable. I don't find this result of having more knowledge gained from free sources rather than from my paid college classes to be too foreign. It makes sense that the amount of people contributing to well written upon topics raises the quality of the material presented. 

A single teacher molding his material over his career is good, but stands no match over the thousands of hours that are crowd sourced into some wiki pages. I don't blame the teacher for this, who is really to blame is the governing institution for not seeing this and adapting. If only we were to start implementing new practices that educate people far better, in larger numbers, and with greater accessibility, we could take a step in the right direction to solving a large number of our current problems.

Fortunately this request is already being tackled by the growing number of internet located educational webpages, From simple one man setups evolving into something  far more reaching, to large established institutions providing introductory topics in conjunction with on campus courses, we have begun to experience the largest shift in human learning sense the printing press. It's impact may feel comparably  played down relative to the press, but this is only due to the large numbers of avenues for learning in this day and age. This new age learning will trickle down in time to the poorest populations, creating a new more educated generation. This won't happen overnight but with the knowledge that it is already present, we can better perceive it if encounterd.
