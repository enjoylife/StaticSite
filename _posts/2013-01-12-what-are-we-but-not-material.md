We manipulate the material present in our universe, using our interfaces to it.From our intricate intelligence contained within our brain, granting us the ability to manipulate solutions on the materials around us. To our kinesthetic interactions shaping the dimension of those said materials. To our perception of the relative speeds of particles of material entering our eyes, the list goes on and on.

Curated by the seemingly endless dimension of time, we are highly deliberate intersections of our universes possible material configurations. The scope of our being is beyond our contained materials usefulness.  And therefore beyond our current consciouses understanding.
