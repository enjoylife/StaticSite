<p>An interesting dynamic of our modern day sports is the scripted / repetitive nature of it all. How every game, season, series, etc, varies only in the teams and players. Guaranteed constants are the rules of the game, with their repetitive starts and stops, fouls, penalties etc. This aspect of our sports, the “game” part, has been around for thousands of years.

<p>What is vastly different and new, for our living generations is two fold. The immensity of it’s public scope and the life improving of the players descendants. AKA the ridiculous sums of money some players receive Securing or more likely enabling a better future for their kids.<cite><a href="http://www.forbes.com/athletes/list/" rel="cite" target="_blank">Forbes</a><cite></p>


<p>Every player and angle, is watched by millions. Initially seen from by those connected to the prime communications channels. I'm talking Satellite / Cable T.V. here. And then to the millions more from all corners of the globe, over the distributed internet sites, replaying and highlighting the action. This large amount publicity has economic power behind it. Apply simple supply and demand and logically if follows how the money can be involved.<b>TODO</b>: This is a topic in of its self<a href="http://jse.sagepub.com/" rel="cite" target="_blank">JSE</a></p>


<p>Watching the NFL playoffs, I found something recently intriguing invoking this idea. Specific I might add, to the aforementioned idea of increased media attention. </p>


<p>It was an AFC wild card game between cinncinati bengals and the Huston Texans.  4th quarter, clock ticking down inevitably in a bengal loss, the next upcoming game already in the announcers discussions, and the camera switching to the Texans team showing their excitement as they waste the time down. From here I watched as both teams made the customary meeting in the middle for a post game handshake. It was at this moment that had the insight of how odd it was to for this select group to be swarming in the middle of the field. What do you mean by "select group" you might ask ? Well not only are there the players, but there is also the gathering of id wearing cameramen and rsporters. (Aside: I rate sports stations on these two factors; the hotness and game knowledge of their female reporters. If they have a beautiful and intelligent woman out there, they must be doing something right <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Erin+Andrews&oq=Erin+Andrews&aqs=chrome.0.57j60j62l3.257&sugexp=chrome,mod=3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" rel="cite" target="_blank">Erin Andrews</a> :) </p> 


<p>Back to the point of the post game publicity. So we have Players, reporters, the residual field crew, and the security for all these high profile actors.( Deliberate choice of the word  actor here, I'll get to it in a sec). <p>

<p>What it is often overlooked, though it is the fact that not all players are out on the field. Now here is where I came upon the question that got me to all this thinking. "Who / What decides which players stay out and get to answer questions from reporters, receive camera air time,  and in general, get continuall name exposure?" </p>


<p>There must be factors involved in this decision. It can't just be a monkey throwing darts on a board, or as simple as picking names out of a hat.  Thought about this for a bit, and I have come up with some initial ideas that I think are intuitive or just plain obvious. (Most of what I talk about is directed toward football but you can abstract the ideas to most others sports as well)</p>


<p>First thing that comes to mind is the preference towards the best of the best. It's in our nature to be attraticed to those that are better than others.(TODO citation). Top scoring and performing athletes in some sense also deserve the media attention that they worked hard for. Competive sports are increasingly more selective with ever larger numbers vying for this increased attention, and not to forget money. Still along these lines is the ever increasing abilities we can extract from our bodies. The small, selective numbers of our population having the genetics for nessacary the performance is another factor contributing to this competition.</p>


<p>Not only is preformance a factor, but brand recognition and brand positioning, I think are in play. In football the most important(or at least as decided by the media) is the QB. If I was a smart owner I would make sure that my most important player was the most publizied. I would want a consistent public appearance to complement a long lasting historic team identity. Think of Green Bay and Bret Favre here. <cite><a href="http://sportfoliomanagement.blogspot.com/2012/08/this-past-semester-i-took-class-called.html" target="_blank">Sportfolio</a><cite></p>


I also believe player distinctness has a factor too. We know certain players by their differenting attributes more easily and this I would play up even if they weren't the best of that position.  We know Teebow for his faith, Troy Palamalu by his hair, RG3 by his socks, etc. (2/3 are quarter backs in this list. Seems like a likely ratio for the amount of publicity  QB's get compared to other positions).


<p>This is a discussion I think warrant's some back and forth. If you have any opinions that are useful for such a discussion, email me @  [matt dot d dot clemens at gmail dot com]</p>
