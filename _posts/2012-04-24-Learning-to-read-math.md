title: Learning to read math
tags: [algorithms]
---

I am a decent student. I study hard, complete work diligently, and participate
with my fellow students. However I have pretty big deficency that holds me back.
That difficulty is understanding equations written in formal textbooks,
which is unfortunatly how most of my physics, calculus, and various algorithms
books written. I upon reading this type of material I become frustrated and my
poorformance suffers. 

One of those said books  was [The Algorithm Design
Manual][algo]. One of the more intersting sections was on graph data structures.
Learing from Skiena's book is actually quite fun because an aspect of Skiena's book is the reference's to lots of different implementations of the discussed algorithms. And me being a tab happy
learner will follow alot of links from those libraries, taking me farther and
farther down the rabbit hole of information on the topic. 

The problem was, just like in class, I only had a shallow understanding of the
maths and notation that was involed, and consequently I understood  only a
fraction of what I was reading. This pattern of reading things that I was
interested in, and expecting myself to just understand it, had to stop. 

One night while in this crippling pattern I just sorta said fuck it, that's it,
im not going to half-ass this shit anymore. [I can't just assume that i'll
eventually just change][wiki].

So to overcome my lack of mathmatical comprehension in the literature I set out
that night, and what felt like every day, time to specificly force myself to
solve a moderately hard problem that I could tackle and walk away with skills to
solve problems like it in the future. If I didn't understand a certain idea or
concept, I would backtrack and learn about that, and if their was stuff within
that I did not understand I would learn the concepts of that before moving on. This sort of
process was obviously slow to get anything done, but it allowed me to fully
understand the needed prerequisites to fully grasp the higher level topic that I
started with in the first place.
